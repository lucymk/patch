            <h1>What's a patch?</h1>
            <p>A patch is a group of people who co-own a house or other dwelling and live together in it. Also known as a housing co-op, but don't let that scare you.</p>
            <p>No landlords involved. You all pay (reasonable!) rent which goes towards paying off your mortgage. You can paint your walls, renovate the garden and choose your own housemates. You won't get kicked out, and your rent will only go up if you choose to put it up.</p>
